MediaTakeOut Headline Generator from Robert Elwell

I love MediaTakeOut. So I decided to make a language model for it. 

I ain't copywriting shit, all this open-source software is legit. I don't mind if you look around the code a little bit.

mto-scrape.py 
	Run this first. It grabs headlines from MediaTakeOut. 
	It's really that easy. Takes <1hr.

mto-analyze.py
	Run this to get some statistics about what you pulled. 
	You need the sentences.prepped file it generates to run 
	your language model.

mto-languagemodel.py
	This actually builds out the fake headlines. Because I'm lazy 
	and I'm using NLTK's Text class (the regular ngram model won't 
	pickle!), I'm just writing to a file from stdout. 
	Options are provided in this, so take a look.

generated.txt
	Here's an example of ~20k headlines. I think that it might be 
	adding in newlines to the language model, 
	so I need to fix that eventually. Not today though.


Requires NLTK with the punkt and stopwords dictionaries downloaded.
