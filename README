MediaTakeOut Headline Generator from Robert Elwell

I love MediaTakeOut. So I decided to make a language model for it. 

I ain't copywriting shit, all this open-source software is legit. 
I don't mind if you look around the code a little bit.

mto-scrape.py 
	Run this first. It grabs headlines from MediaTakeOut. 
	It's really that easy. Takes <1hr.

mto-analyze.py
	Run this to get some statistics about what you pulled. 
	You need the sentences.prepped file it generates to run 
	your language model.

mto-languagemodel.py
	This actually builds out the fake headlines. Because I'm lazy 
	and I'm using NLTK's Text and NGram language model classes.
	I'm just writing to a file from stdout to get my sentences.
	Options are provided in this, so take a look.

generated.txt
	Here's an example of headlines. 
	Take a look at it in action at

Requires NLTK with the punkt and stopwords dictionaries downloaded.
